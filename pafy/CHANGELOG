Notes:

This version should be fully backward compatible with the previous version.
Pafy objects retain the pafy.streams list containing regular streams as before (video + audio)
In addition, there are now two new stream lists;
	pafy.audiostreams is a list of audio only streams (m4a and ogg vorbis where available)
	pafy.videostreams is a list of video only streams (m4v)
Further, there is a pafy.allstreams list containing the union of all three aforementioned lists
